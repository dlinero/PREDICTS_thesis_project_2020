This project folder constains the scripts for data processing and output files.

Note that the version of the PREDICTS database used in this analysis is currently not public and, therefore, has not been uploaded. 
All the output tables generated from this database are also not included in this folder. 
Please contact Dr Andy Purvis for access to the database.

* The R folder contains the scripts with function definitions
* The output folder contains the tables generated during data processing, and the figures and tables generated as results.
* The reports folder contains R Markdown files used to create PDFs showing the code and output for each stage of data analysis. 
* The scripts folder contains the code used for every stage of data analysis and processing 


The naming scheme indicates the stage of the process in which each file was used or generated:
1. Data filtering
2. Statistical analysis
3. Inspection of results
4. Robust modelling
5. Plotting
6. Descriptive statistics
